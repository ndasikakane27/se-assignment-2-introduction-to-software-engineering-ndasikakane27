# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Define Software Engineering: It is a systematic application that plays a crutial role in technology. It digitize the way we communicate, how we procure goods, how we transact, etc

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): These are stages or roadmap which software development should follow for successful implementation in meeting client's needs.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Requirements: This is a stage where you identify the need of the user, but gathering information & documenting the system requirements to fulfil the user's need. Design: This is where you design the software blueprint & user interface. Implementation: This is a stage where you write the code & build the software according to the user's specification guided by the design specifications. Testing:This is a stage where different scenarios are tested to ensure that the software is delivering the expected outputs. Deployment: This is a stage when the software has passed the tests and is being released to the user to start using it. Maintenance:is when the developer provides support, updates and improve the software with the new features that might add value to a client to make life easy. E.g. providing an auto updating software without resetting current data.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile works in incremental stages to identify and resolve issues in the development stages. whereas Waterfall is done in milestones.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall you wait for each stage to be done and then move to the next stage. It is sequential. It works for short projects. Agile: before the stage is completed a new stage can be started, it is not dependent on 1 stage to be completed, it is flexible. I is best suited for long term projects
Requirements Engineering: 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. It refers to the process of defining, documenting and maitaining requirements in engineering design process.It defines and uderstands the customer's needs and facilitates communication between relavant stakeholders and development teams.
Software Design Principles:
Solid: Stands for Single responsibility principal. Open-closed , Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion which aims at making software understandable, boost scalability and facilitates maintanance. Least: focuses on aims at reducing the learning curve by leveraging existing knowledge by users. Economies:it evaluates options based on which one will add more value at a reasonable cost.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? It emphisizes separating the functionalities of the program into managable clusters for the purpose of implementation & maintanance.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing -Is the first level of testing used to test if software satisfy the given requirements as an individual component, integration testing- It test te data flow from oe modele to another module to iedentify the defects when systems are integrated, system testing- it is a end to end testing process andinvloves testing testing the application as a whole, acceptance testing- this is when the application is released to the end user to test and apply in real life scenarios). Why is testing crucial in software development? So we ensure that the application will deliver what is required by the end user and identify, fix any errors that might arise in real time.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. They are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time e.g. GIT, SVN, Mercurial.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? They serve as a liaison between the development team & other stakeholders in a software project. They are responsible for communicating project status, manage changes and help complete the project on scheduled time. Challenges are limited resources e.g. budget constraints, time management, team coordination and unclear project goals.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? it is a process of modifying, changig and updating a software system to improve performance and adapt to changing environment. It is essential because it ensures functionality, security & reliability of software systems by addressing issues enhancing performance & adapting to changes.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? Safety, acceptable risk, compliance, confidentiality, data integrity and conflict of interest. How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? is to adhere to the terms of non-disclosure policy and being honest to their client.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
